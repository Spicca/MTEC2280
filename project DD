  something like this were after a fight the play picks which way they want to go
  i have the story ill post it later
  
  its simple all that need to be programmed is that the player after a fight get to pick which way they go,
  
  ex: "you see two doors infront of you one to the left, one to the right"
  this will in turn lead to different ending
